# Quantifying-Climate-Change-Impacts-on-Global-GDP
This project builds a predictive modelling framework to assess how climate change affects global GDP. Using World Bank, OWID, and ERA5 data, it applies econometric and machine learning methods to forecast GDP growth under scenarios (Baseline, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, âˆ’30% COâ‚‚), with rolling-origin validation and uncertainty analysis.
